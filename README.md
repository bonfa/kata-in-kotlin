This project contains the solutions to some kata, which I do periodically to exercise.
Additionally, there is a branch called `only_blank_file`, where there is an empty project with just the basic configuration to perform some exercises in TDD

Most of the kata are performed to train the TDD and are taken from here: https://codingdojo.org/kata/
